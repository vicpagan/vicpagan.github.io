## UH Lost and Found

<h5>Authors: Victor, Jalen, Eisen, Michelle, Sierra</h5>

## Overview

The problem: Whenever an item is lost in UH, it can be difficult to figure out where it ends up since each department/building has its own “lost and found” and there isn’t a unified system for lost and found items on campus for students to access.

The solution: UH accessible website to post lost and found items on campus. Students can identify their items and contact the department to request pick up or post about lost items that can help other students reach out to them if their items have been found.
