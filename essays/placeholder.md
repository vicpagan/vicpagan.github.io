### I. Introduction

AI has been a shaking revelation for the Software Development field as well as in the education process of the concepts pertaining to the subject. While it is not fully understood what effect it will have on the industry as a whole, as time goes on it has shown to become more and more prevalent in its usage for the completion of tasks designated to workers and students alike. Because of this, it has also become a popular point of contention between Software Developers as to whether or not its rampant increase in usage is a good thing or bad thing for the field. 

Despite this rampant growth in popularity, I have personally made it a point for myself not to use any form of AI to assist in my education at UH Manoa simply because I do not want to become reliant on it to solve any problems I may have, whether or not in the area of Software Development or somewhere else like in Physics. While I can understand and respect the purpose of its existence and how it can be used as a tool to assist, I find that more often than not it inhibits the ability of students to conceptualize and understand what they are working with, which can pose an issue further down the line in one's future if left unchecked.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have **not** used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

- Experience WODs e.g. E18

- In-class Practice WODs

- In-class WODs

- Essays

- Final project

- Learning a concept / tutorial

- Answering a question in class or in Discord

- Asking or answering a smart-question

- Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

- Explaining code

- Writing code

- Documenting code

- Quality assurance

- Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

While the original formatting for this essay was to respond to each of these course elements individually as to why or why I did not use AI for them, I have found that to be unnecessary as the reasoning for my choice to not use AI for any of them is the same: 

**Because it was more important for me to find the answer on my own.**

Whether this was through classmates, Stack Overflow, etc., I personally prefer to uphold the idea that it is more important for an individual to conceptualize and understand these topics through their own means of research and assistance from others. Asking AI for answers or to fix something is, in my eyes, equivalent to asking an upperclassman the answers to a homework problem rather than having them tutor you and allow you to solve the answer yourself through guidance. As I like to say, "I'd rather teach myself how to fish than ask a robot for food every day".
