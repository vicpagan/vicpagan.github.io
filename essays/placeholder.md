### I. Introduction

AI has been a shaking revelation for the Software Development field as well as in the education process of the concepts pertaining to the subject. While it is not fully understood what effect it will have on the industry as a whole, as time goes on it has shown to become more and more prevalent in its usage for the completion of tasks designated to workers and students alike. Because of this, it has also become a popular point of contention between Software Developers as to whether or not its rampant increase in usage is a good thing or bad thing for the field. 

Despite this, I have personally made it a point for myself not to use any form of AI to assist in my education at UH Manoa simply because I do not want to become reliant on it for solving any problems I may have, whether or not in the area of Software Development or somewhere else like in Physics. While I can understand and respect the purpose of its existence and how it can be used as a tool to assist, I find that more often than not it inhibits the ability of students to conceptualize and understand what they are working with, which can pose an issue further down the line in one's future if left unchecked.
