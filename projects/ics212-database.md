The image above shows the running result of a database project I developed in my ICS 212 course at UH Manoa. This project was entirely developed on the Unix terminal using Vi as our code editor.

This database project was created in 2 separate phases:

The first phase consisted of code written entirely in C and also split into two parts. Part 1 was creating the front end of the database by creating a user interface with sufficient input validation and allowing it to communicate back and forth with the database file itself. Part 2 was creating said database file using structs to hold the data and a text file to read and write on for the database itself.

The second phase was taking this code and rewriting it in C++ using a linked list class to hold the data as well as read and write it to a text file for the database itself. The user interface was also rewritten in C++ with some minor improvements.

This was one of my favorite projects that I have created so far in my computer science journey at UH Manoa, and it has helped me to learn a lot about C, C++, classes, Unix, text-based IDEs, command line arguments, etc.
